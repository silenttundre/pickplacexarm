# pickplacexarm
This is a little simulation robotic arm that will pick up an object and place it in the box.  This was a project for the Robotics class.  

So, with interactive script, the user can manually capture the positions of the arm and record these positions and actions into a structured dictionary.  This is then saved to a file coordinates.json.  This coordinates.json is use as instructions for the arm to automate the task.
